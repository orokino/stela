# Stela

Stela is a model-agnostic coding agent, starting from a clean fork of
[earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). CLI and TUI first; desktop GUI later.

Start with [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for the fork baseline, decisions, and next-session instructions.
The Claude-compatible prototype is a separate proof of concept, not Stela's implementation.
Recovered proprietary code, prompts, strings, and assets are not included in this fork.
Future capabilities will be implemented from reviewed behavioral findings, with one behavior per
capability and its source and rationale recorded.

## Run Stela from this checkout

Requires Node.js 22.19 or newer, installed checkout dependencies, and hydrated model data.
See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md#verified-checkout-setup) for bootstrap commands.

```bash
node scripts/install-stela.mjs
stela
```

The installer links `~/.local/bin/stela` to this checkout. Keep the checkout in place
and put `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`. It refuses to replace an unrelated existing command,
does not edit shell configuration, and does not modify your existing `pi` installation.
Use `node scripts/install-stela.mjs --bin-dir <directory>` for a different installation
directory, or run `./stela` directly without installing. The installer supports Linux/macOS;
on Windows, run `node stela` from the checkout.

This is a Node-based CLI, **not a self-contained native executable**. Internal package names,
upstream runtime formats, and build tooling are retained.

### State and discovery boundary

- Global settings, credentials, model catalogs, sessions, trust decisions, and resources:
  `~/.stela/agent`.
- Project configuration and resources: `.stela/`, with inherited project-trust rules.
- Overrides: `STELA_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `STELA_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, and `STELA_PACKAGE_DIR`.
  `--session-dir` takes precedence over the session environment override.
- No automatic import or fallback to `~/.pi/agent`, project `.pi/`, or Pi's directory overrides.
  Set up Stela credentials separately with `/login`; generic provider API-key environment variables
  remain available.
- Shared instruction-file and `.agents/skills` discovery remains enabled. Provider-owned credential
  conventions (for example AWS profiles and Google ADC) remain shared. Explicitly configured package
  sources may resolve an existing global npm installation; Stela does not import Pi's package settings.
- CLI child processes receive `AI_AGENT=stela` and `STELA_CODING_AGENT=true`. Inherited shell-session
  metadata still uses `PI_SESSION_*`, `PI_PROVIDER`, `PI_MODEL`, and `PI_REASONING_LEVEL`.
- Experimental source tooling uses `~/.stela/server`, `STELA_SERVER_DIR`, and `STELA_SERVER_ID`.
  The installed `stela` launcher uses the regular CLI, not the experimental command entry.

Stela self-update is disabled: update this source checkout deliberately. `stela update --extensions`
and `stela update --models` retain their inherited behavior. Other `PI_*` behavior controls
(including `PI_OFFLINE` and `PI_TELEMETRY`), provider/catalog services, and upstream integrations
remain inherited. State separation is **not a filesystem or process sandbox**.

The Pi documentation below describes the inherited implementation. Substitute `stela` for the
command and `.stela` for agent/project state paths unless using a separate upstream Pi installation.
The configuration and environment references document the cutover.
Upstream history, MIT licensing, and attribution are retained.

# Pi

Pi is a minimal, extensible agent harness that you can make your own.

Adapt Pi to your workflows, not the other way around. Customize Pi with [extensions](packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md), [skills](packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md), [prompt templates](packages/coding-agent/docs/prompt-templates.md), and [themes](packages/coding-agent/docs/themes.md). Bundle them as [Pi packages](packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md) and share via npm or git.

Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub-agents and plan mode. Ask Pi to build what you want, or install a package that does it your way.

Use Pi [interactively](packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md), automate it in [print or JSON mode](packages/coding-agent/docs/cli.md), control it over [RPC](packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md), or build apps with the [Pi TypeScript SDK](packages/coding-agent/docs/sdk.md). See [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw) for a real-world integration.

## Getting started

Install the command-line interface:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```shell
powershell -c "irm https://pi.dev/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer pins all dependencies and updates Pi with `pi update`. Alternatively, install directly with npm, which does not pin transitive dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Pi requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. The macOS, Linux, and Windows installers can install it if needed. Pi does not require dependency lifecycle scripts for a normal npm installation.

Start Pi in the directory where you want it to work:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pi
```

For a built-in AI provider, run `/login` inside Pi to connect a subscription or API key. Then give Pi a task.

See the [documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest) for full setup and usage instructions, or [visit pi.dev](https://pi.dev) for demos.

## Run with Nix

```bash
nix run github:earendil-works/pi/stable
```

`stable` points at the latest release. Install it with `nix profile add github:earendil-works/pi/stable` and update with `nix profile upgrade pi`. Use a release tag such as `github:earendil-works/pi/v1.0.0` to pin a version, or `github:earendil-works/pi` for unreleased changes on `main`. Nix builds Pi from source.

Supports ARM64 and x86-64 on Linux and macOS. Use `nix build .` or `nix run .` to build or run your checkout.

Nix builds are offline, so the bundled model data comes from a pi.dev model catalog revision pinned in `nix/model-catalog.json`. At runtime, Pi still overlays newer catalog data from pi.dev as usual. The Nix workflow replaces the pin on `main` when it no longer matches the checkout, for example after a provider is added or gains a new model type. To refresh it by hand:

```bash
npm run update:model-catalog-pin
```

## Permissions & Containerization

Pi does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox Pi. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns:

- **Gondolin extension**: keep `pi` and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole `pi` process in a local container for simple isolation.
- **OpenShell**: run the whole `pi` process in a policy-controlled sandbox.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project-specific rules (for both humans and agents).  Longer term plans for Pi can also be found in [RFCs](https://rfc.earendil.com/keyword/pi/).

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run build         # Refresh model data, then build all packages
npm run build:offline # Rebuild using existing model data without network access
npm run check         # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
./pi-test.sh         # Run pi from sources (can be run from any directory)
```

### Using local packages outside the monorepo

Build every public package into one coherent local artifact set:

```bash
npm run pack:packages -- --out .artifacts/pi-packages
```

This refreshes model data before building `pi-ai`. To avoid network access when
model data is already hydrated, pass `--offline-model-data`.

Then configure an external project to consume one package and resolve all of
its Pi dependencies from the same artifact set. npm is the default:

```bash
node scripts/use-local-packages.mjs \
  --manifest .artifacts/pi-packages/manifest.json \
  --consumer ../my-project \
  --package @earendil-works/pi-durable \
  --package @earendil-works/pi-agent-core
cd ../my-project
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

For a pnpm project, point `--consumer` at the workspace root:

```bash
node scripts/use-local-packages.mjs \
  --manifest .artifacts/pi-packages/manifest.json \
  --consumer ../my-project \
  --package @earendil-works/pi-agent-core \
  --package-manager pnpm
cd ../my-project
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

Repeat `--package` for each direct dependency. The command updates the
consumer's `package.json` with content-addressed local `file:` references. It
writes transitive overrides to `package.json` for npm or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
for pnpm. Keep the artifact directory available while installing or updating
the consumer. Re-run both commands after changing Pi source.

## Building standalone binaries from release source

GitHub releases include a versioned source archive covered by the release's `SHA256SUMS` file. Extract it and run the same build script used for the official standalone binaries:

```bash
VERSION="<release-version>"
tar -xzf "pi-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz"
cd "pi-${VERSION}"
./scripts/build-binaries.sh --offline-model-data --platform linux-x64 --out "$PWD/out"
```

The archive includes release model data and native prebuilds. `--offline-model-data` uses that model data without refreshing provider catalogs. The script installs dependencies and builds the executable with its runtime assets; pass `--skip-install` if dependencies are already provided.

## Supply-chain hardening

We treat npm dependency changes as reviewed code changes.

- Direct external dependencies are pinned to exact versions. Internal workspace packages remain version-ranged.
- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true` and `min-release-age=2` to avoid same-day dependency releases during npm resolution.
- `package-lock.json` is the dependency ground truth. Pre-commit blocks accidental lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` is set.
- `npm run check` verifies pinned direct deps, native TypeScript import compatibility, and the generated coding-agent install lock.
- The pi.dev installer installs from `packages/coding-agent/install-lock/`, generated from the root lockfile, to pin transitive deps. The npm package does not pin transitive deps.
- Local release smoke tests and npm publication use the same tarball packer; npm publishes the validated tarballs rather than repacking workspace directories.
- Local release installs, documented npm installs, and `pi update --self` use `--ignore-scripts` where supported.
- CI installs with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and a scheduled GitHub workflow runs `npm audit --omit=dev` plus `npm audit signatures --omit=dev`.
- Install lock generation has an explicit allowlist for dependency lifecycle scripts; new lifecycle-script deps fail checks until reviewed.

## Share your OSS coding agent sessions

If you use Pi or other coding agents for open source work, please share your sessions.

Public OSS session data helps improve coding agents with real-world tasks, tool use, failures, and fixes instead of toy benchmarks.

For the full explanation, see [this post on X](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2037811643774652911).

To publish sessions, use [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). Read its README.md for setup instructions. All you need is a Hugging Face account, the Hugging Face CLI, and `pi-share-hf`.

You can also watch [this video](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2041151967695634619), where I show how I publish my `pi-mono` sessions.

I regularly publish my own `pi-mono` work sessions here:

- [badlogicgames/pi-mono on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/badlogicgames/pi-mono)
